# Landing Page Project (Archived)

## Overview
This project is a simple **landing page** built using **HTML and CSS** as part of an early learning exercise. It was created while following **The Odin Project** curriculum to practice page layout, semantic HTML, and basic styling with CSS.

The page consists of common landing page sections such as a header, hero area, information cards, a quote section, a call-to-action, and a footer.

This project is now **archived** and is no longer actively maintained. It remains as a snapshot of early progress in learning front-end development fundamentals.

---

## Purpose
The main goals of this project were to:
- Practice writing **semantic HTML**
- Learn and apply **CSS layout techniques**
- Understand how to structure a complete web page
- Work with fonts, spacing, and visual hierarchy
- Follow a design specification and recreate it in code

This project was created purely for educational purposes.

---

## Features
- Header with logo text and navigation links
- Hero section with main heading, subtext, button, and image placeholder
- Information section with multiple content blocks
- Quote/testimonial section
- Call-to-action section with sign-up button
- Footer with copyright text

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Page structure and content
- **CSS** – Layout, styling, and typography
- **Google Fonts (Roboto)** – Font styling

No JavaScript or external frameworks are used.

---

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – Main HTML file containing the page structure
- `style.css` – Stylesheet for layout and visual design

---

## How It Works
The landing page is entirely static and works by:
- Structuring content using HTML elements such as headers, divs, lists, and buttons
- Styling and positioning content using CSS
- Applying fonts and spacing for visual clarity and hierarchy

---

## Running the Project
To view the landing page locally:
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser

No build steps or dependencies are required.

## Project Status
📦 **Archived**

This project is no longer under development. It reflects an early stage of learning HTML and CSS and may not follow modern best practices or optimal layout techniques.

---

## Possible Improvements (Not Implemented)
- Responsive design for smaller screen sizes
- Improved accessibility (semantic roles, contrast, alt text usage)
- Replace placeholder content with real images and links
- Cleaner or more scalable CSS structure
- Hover and focus states for interactive elements
